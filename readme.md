# Knights Travails

## Description

Knight's Travails is an interactive web application that demonstrates the ability of a knight on a chessboard to move from one square to any other square, given enough steps. This project serves as an implementation of finding the shortest path between a knight and its destination using a **breadth-first search algorithm**. Take a peek at [`pathfinder.js`](src/modules/pathFinder.js) file.

This project was completed as a part of The Odin Project. Here's the [project source](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails).
